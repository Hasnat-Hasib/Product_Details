# reactjs-product-details-example
This is an example workout with reactjs

## Technologies
This example uses react, react-redux and reactstrap libraries. There is a static json data, so there is no axios or any http helper for now.

## How to run
Like most of the javascript applications, run **npm install** in the root folder of the project, then execute: **npm run start**.
